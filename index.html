          Procrastination is more scientifically than you think
        </h3>
        <p class="info">
          Procrastination has been a huge issue since the beginning of humanity;
          lamentably, we do not have evidence that humans started
          procrastinating since we became conciseness about our existence.
          However, we do have a piece of information that leads us to know that
          procrastination was an issue even before the existence of the
          technology that makes us in the present day super distracted.
          Approximately in 700 B.C., an ancient Greek poet, Hesiod, proclaimed
          in a poem called "Work and Days." He expressed, "Do not put your work
          off till tomorrow and the day after." The sentence is clear evidence
          that during the 8th century, procrastination was already an issue for
          humans, but is this evidence enough to claim that procrastination
          existed long before the new technologies appeared? During the 8th
          century, poetry was one of the fundamental ways of expressing ideas to
          the public. Also, poetry is based on human dilemmas on issues such as
          love, death, life, and others. Hence, poetry was a respectful skill
          that not everyone could do, only notable people during that time,
          which means that procrastination existed long ago.
        </p>
        <p class="info connected">
          Nevertheless, procrastination is already in our genes; our ancestors
          used to fight, flee, feed or mate when they felt the urge to do it, as
          lions or other animals do. They eat, hunt, or play among them when
          they felt doing it; there is no plan, no future, and they only live
          the present and do what their bodies want at that moment. However,
          imagination plays a significant role in this scenario; it lets humans
          develop an enormous sense of the future, see reality, imagine how it
          could be different, and translate those imaginations into a new
          reality. We can prepare for the hypothetical future, and we even have
          the conciseness that if we continue doing the same action every day,
          something will happen, either bad or good. We have a morality that
          affects our feelings, making us feel unproductive and sometimes
          useless, which is an indicator when we do something that we know is
          not worth it. Unlike animals, when they rest all day, they do not feel
          the same feeling as us. Hence, despite our mental time travel skill to
          predict the future based on our past experiences and our level of
          self-awareness, self-reflection, and morality that regulates our
          feelings as an indicator of productivity, comes the question, why do
          we still procrastinate?

        <h3 id="title2">What is procrastination?</h3>
        <img src="https://www.myhrtoolkit.com/hubfs/workplace-procrastination.jpg" alt="pic" />
        <p class="author">New Africa/Shutterstock</p>
        <p class="info">
          "Procrastination is the act of delaying or putting off tasks until the
          last minute, or past their deadline" (Cherry). Similarly, the
          dictionary defines procrastination as "the action of delaying or
          postponing something." We can agree that procrastination's definition
          is easy to understand; it is just unnecessarily postponing things and
          actions for later because we do not "feel" like doing them. Later in
          the essay, I will explain why this happens, but first, let us
          understand why procrastination is a big deal and how it affects us.
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          Procrastination is dangerous and has many adverse effects such as
          decrement in academic performance, worse financial status, a rise of
          issues in relationships with people, reduced well-being, and worse
          mental and physical health, plus the feeling of being useless.
          Procrastination is addictive because the more someone procrastinates,
          the more they will develop the habit of being lazy; it is like
          procrastination generates more procrastination. Hence, procrastination
          is a vicious cycle; if an individual does not do anything today, that
          individual will be stuck the next day. This lack of action leads to
          more procrastination, which makes the individual feel useless, plus
          that feeling and thinking of "I have not done anything today yet, so
          why am I going to start now? So, just let's take a day off." And so
          on, every day will become a day off.

        <h3 id="title4">Causes of why we procrastinate</h3>
        <img src="https://solvingprocrastination.com/wp-content/uploads/Procrastination-and-Negative-Affect.png" alt="pic" />
        <p class="author">solvingprocrastination.com</p>
        <p class="info">
          Why does this happens? Why do we keep procrastinating? If we know, it
          is terrible for us, and even sometimes, we are conscious that we are
          not doing what we should. Thankfully, there is a science behind it.
          Some studies in an article by Priya Babu concluded that students with
          high self-esteem procrastinate less, whereas those who procrastinate
          more have comparatively lower self-esteem. Also, other studies
          revealed that the human brain is wired to be lazy. According to
          Hindustan Times, a new study showed that our brains may simply be
          wired to prefer lying on the couch and that human brains work harder
          to pick physical activity over relaxation. Humans have been connected
          to laziness since the beginning of time; that is why we are so greedy
          sometimes because we only want a simple and easy life by resting and
          relaxing while doing nothing. Hence, procrastination is an action our
          brain uses to stop thinking and enjoy the "free" time.
        </p>
        <p class="info connected">
          Furthermore, procrastination is in our genes of survival as well
          because human brains are programmed to conserve energy, the process of
          conserving energy has been essential for our survival long time ago
          with this energy conserved, we were more efficient in searching for
          food, making shelter, mate, and most importantly, avoiding predators.
          According to Ewan McNay, the brain burns more energy during an intense
          cognitive task than you would vegging out watching TV or whatever.
          These two statements are essential to put together; our brain loves
          not to do anything that takes much energy and effort because of our
          survival genes of storing energy, and this is because solid cognitive
          tasks make our brain lose energy.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 id="title5">Pleasure hormone (Dopamine)</h3>
        <img src="https://i.insider.com/5aa30c2f90bed868078b4668?width=700" alt="pic"/>
        <p class="author">Samantha Lee/Business Insider</p>
        <p class="info">
          Dopamine hormone is known as the "pleasure hormone" because it gives
          us a sense of pleasure and the motivation to do something.
          Practically, Dopamine is a reward from our brain when we do something
          we like. "Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. It's a big
          part of our unique human ability to think and plan. It helps us
          strive, focus, and find things interesting." (Cristol). Thus, Dopamine
          is our primary reward dose from our brain when we do something our
          brain likes. One of these things is just resting and doing nothing,
          like sitting on the couch and watching some TV series with a piece of
          chocolate on our side and a good Coca-Cola next to it; our brain
          generates a high level of Dopamine, and not only because our brain
          likes it, also because that bar of chocolate and Coca-Cola generates
          Dopamine as well. So, we are getting a big reward of Dopamine (that
          feeling of pleasure) at that moment, as well as the feeling that we
          have nothing to worry about and just "enjoy" our "free" time, while in
          our background life, we have more than hundred things to do and finish
          it. However, we say, "why would I worry about it? If I still have one
          week to complete it," the problem is that we think that we have one
          week, but instead, we are only having one day because, at that moment,
          that we left ourselves on that couch assuming that we have time, that
          action and choice will still occur until the deadline. To be clear, I
          am not saying that we have to complete everything weeks before the
          deadline; I am just saying that we must realize that these actions and
          thought processes happen, that this kind of behavior our brain loves,
          and the brain will do anything and excuse with many different thoughts
          to avoid doing what we must do.
        </p>

        <h3 id="title6">Procrastination as a habit</h3>

        <p class="author">thehabitstation.com</p>
        <p class="info">
          Dopamine reward is not the only way of getting to procrastinate more
          and more; Dopamine is just the starting point of something worse. What
          is worse than Dopamine is habits, which is what we practice regularly
          and is hard to give up. Here is when it gets complicated because we
          can have our doses of Dopamine by avoiding tasks that our brain finds
          hard to do, but once is okay, as well as twice, but when we start to
          do it regularly, we also start to create a habit, and what is even
          worse is that we do not even realize that we are creating the habit.
          In the book of Charles Duhigg, "The Power of Habit," he explains that
          creating a habit consist of three parts: A cue, a routine, and a
          reward. To translate this into our example of creating a
          procrastination habit, we have a: New task with a deadline due one
          week from now (cue), "I have time" thought without even checking how
          hard it would be the task (routine), and go to distract ourselves by
          doing an effortless thing (reward).
        </p>
        <p class="info connected">
          Furthermore, how long do we have to do it to form this new habit of
          procrastinating? According to a 2009 European Journal of Social
          Psychology study, "The average modelled time to plateau in this sample
          was 66 days, but the range was from 18 to 254 days." (Lally 1007).
          Hence, if we do this for 66 days straight (average), congratulations,
          we have created a new habit, the habit of procrastination. Once this
          habit is created, it is super hard to stop, so it is essential to
          realize that we are procrastinators and train our brain to figure out
          when the cue is coming to avoid the routine and the reward that leads
          to creating the habit of procrastination.

        <p class="info">
          Procrastination is usual; we cannot blame or feel guilty about
          ourselves when we sometimes procrastinate because it is normal
          behavior, and sometimes it is even healthy to enjoy doing effortless
          things so we can clear our minds, and each person has a way of doing
          this. The issue here is what kind of effortless things we do to clear
          our minds. Some people play instruments, others meditate, and some go
          to workouts, among many other activities. However, there are as well
          plenty of people who, instead of clearing their minds and doing
          nothing for a moment by doing something that at the same time is
          "healthy" or "fruitfulness" for their lives, grab their phone and open
          Instagram or TikTok and they spend 2 to 4 hours there and sometimes
          even more. So, the issues are time spent when procrastinating, what we
          do to procrastinate, and most importantly, how regularly we are. If we
          procrastinate just one day, but by doing something healthy for us, it
          is okay, but it is essential to start doing the task as soon as
          possible during that day or the next day. However, what if we are
          already addictive procrastinators but want to stop being postponers.
          How do we overcome procrastination?
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2 id="title8">Overcoming procrastination</h2>
        <h3 id="title9">Step 1</h3>
        <p class="info">
          We must forgive ourselves because we procrastinated in the past. Some
          studies show that "Results revealed that among students who reported
          high levels of self-forgiveness for procrastinating on studying for
          the first examination, procrastination on preparing for the subsequent
          examination was reduced." (Wohl). Thus, self-forgiveness can help us
          to feel more positive about ourselves and reduce future
          procrastination. In addition, another tactic is to practice
          self-compassion, which is treating ourselves with kindness when trying
          to understand our mistakes and failures. To support this idea of
          self-compassion, a study by Dr. Sirois found that lower levels of
          self-compassion may explain some of the stress experienced by
          procrastinators and interventions that promote self-compassion could
          therefore be beneficial for these individuals. These tactics proven by
          studies are all connected to our self-esteem because to first feel
          worth, we need to forgive ourselves from the past to progress and try
          to get better, and self-esteem is crucial in order to avoid
          procrastination. When we procrastinate, our brain takes that task as a
          threat to our self-esteem because if we overthink the task, we may end
          up with the conclusion that it is a difficult task, and it will
          generate the fear of not being able to accomplish it because of the "I
          am not smart" thought, without even read what the task about is.
          Ironically, the best way to stop those fears is action.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 id="title10">Step 2</h3>
        <p class="info">
          We need to understand what procrastination is and why it is caused; in
          that way, unconsciously, we will be able to identify and recognize
          when we are about to procrastinate; we will be able to identify that
          cue that makes us want to start a routine, once we identify the cue,
          we will be able to stop at that moment and avoid doing the routine.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 id="title11">Step 3</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Once the cue is identified and we know that we want to procrastinate,
          we need to combat a little against our brain and try to hack our brain
          in order to make our brain find worthy of doing the task right now;
          one good way of doing it is to tell ourselves "I will just do it for 5
          minutes, then I am free to stop." If the task is not enjoyable for
          that person, the chances of stopping after 5 minutes are high.
          However, if that person does that again after an hour or even just the
          next day, there will be a moment where, in most cases, after the timer
          stops, most of the people, knowing that they could stop if they wanted
          to, they will give them a little extra time and incentive to continue
          for at least a little more minutes. On the other hand, another hack
          people can use to avoid procrastination is just starting it; what do I
          mean by this? I am talking about a rule that, according to Mel Robbins
          in her book "The 5 Seconds Rule," when an opportunity arises, or you
          must do something, do not think about it; just count 5-4-3-2-1 and
          decide. After five seconds, your brain will start to betray you, and
          it will kill your motivation to do what you must do. If a person wants
          to run every morning, when waking up, instead of thinking if it will
          be a good idea, just count 5-4-3-2-1 and go. Otherwise, our brain will
          have the chance to overthink it, and overthinking is never good.
          However, do not confuse it with thinking logically; this rule is good
          when we need to take any action we know we must do; otherwise, we will
          feel bad if we do not do it. However, these actions must be thought
          out clearly before making this choice. As an example, I know that
          eating sugar is not suitable for me. So first, I will think logically
          about and even research why overeating sugar is terrible for the body
          (that is the logical thinking I made), then I confirm that choice and
          start avoiding sugar. Then I go out with friends to have dinner, and I
          get the chance to eat sugar in a dessert, so I feel tempted by it
          because I have already had that habit of eating a dessert every time I
          go to have dinner, and that is the moment of doing the 5 seconds rule.
          At first, there was logical thinking to decide the choice that a
          person will make from now on, then to make the action the 5 minutes
          rule will be helpful. Also, one of the best ways to avoid
          procrastination is to avoid distractions, active focus mode, or turn
          off smartphones and finish what you must do.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 id="title12">Step 4</h3>
        <p class="info">
          Is essential always to promise our brain that we will give it a reward
          after doing what we were planning to do. The thing to notice here is
          that it has to be something your brain wants. It can be anything,
          while, of course, it is not something that will destroy you, like
          drugs or any other unhealthy thing. What I found helpful during this
          practice is that I used to tell my brain that I was going to play
          PlayStation after finishing my homework until I got bored of playing.
          So, the reward at first worked as a trick to hack the brain to make it
          do the task, and then after finishing the task, change the reward at
          the last moment. What was more interesting is that this reward worked
          in the same way as the 5 minutes rule because after I finished my
          homework, I was feeling already productive, practical, and super
          motivated to continue being productive, so instead of playing video
          games, I ended up doing online courses, or working out at the gym, or
          hanging out with my friends.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 id="title13">Step 5</h3>
        <p class="info">
          We must self-sabotage our thoughts. The way of doing this is to change
          the way we speak to ourselves; instead of saying "I have to do this
          task," we should change to "I choose to do this task," this works
          because we humans are likely not to obey easily, and mostly when we
          are obligated to do something that we do not want to. We like to blame
          others or delegate work that we should do to others because the task
          was not our choice. However, if we trick our brain by letting it know
          that we choose to do something, the brain will focus on doing it
          because we let the brain feel the freedom of choice and not the
          feeling of being obligated to do it. Thus, when we want to stop
          procrastinating, we could trick the brain by saying, "I want to do
          this task" or "I choose to do this task," and honestly believe it.
          Otherwise, it will not work; we need motivation, and what better
          motivation than genuinely wanting to do something.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h2 id="title14">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="info">
          Procrastination is something that affects all of us; there are
          multiple ways of procrastinating, and the main idea is to choose in
          which way we want to procrastinate. Plus, we can avoid procrastination
          by applying different thinking processes or rule techniques like "The
          5 Second Rule" or "The 5 Minutes Rule." It is also essential to notice
          that procrastination is a problem everyone has, and we should not
          blame others for not accomplishing a task by the due date. People need
          to understand procrastination, the science behind it, and how to avoid
          this problem because it is not super easy to stop, but at the same
          time, it is not super complicated to stop.
